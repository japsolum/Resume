        <div class = "child" id="youngerYearsText"> My name is James, I have always loved the tech world and the idea of computer programming.
          Before I had even started in highschool I had self-taught myself HTML 4.0 and had 3-4 full websites
          running on my own. In highschool I continued that path by taking every class my school had from powerpoint and
          excel to more in depth classes like web design, visual basic, and c++.
